# data-cleaning
Cleaned a data set of laboratory confirmed influenza cases in New York beginning in 2009 using Pandas, Numpy, and Plotly (Python 3). 
This project drops unnecessary columns and rows in the DataFrame and changes the Index of the DataFrame to a more unique identifier. 
Using Plotly, it makes a pie chart showing incidences by county in the time frame 2011-2012, categorizing counties incidences totaling less than 200 into an ‘other’ category.
